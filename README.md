*In a land where shepherds' pipes once played, a silent shadow now is laid. I am the whisper on the breeze, the sorrow hidden in the trees. The hand that writes, the eye that sees, and yet I rest beneath the leaves. A promise made, a truth denied, a name upon a stone, inside. Though joy and beauty fill the scene, my presence lingers, dark and keen.*
