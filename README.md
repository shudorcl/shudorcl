*Upon the sun-drenched marble, where the laugh was brief and gold, I cast a line no shadow can behold.*

*The shepherd's crown is woven with my name, yet the song he sings forgets from whence I came.*

---

* I am the echo of a forgotten feast,
* The geometry of a beast unseen,
* Drawn upon a landscape ever-green.

---

I hold the perfect hour captive in my gaze, turning crystal clarity to maze.

> **What blooms must bow, and in that silent shift, you find the token of my cryptic gift.**
